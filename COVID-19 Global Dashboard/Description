This dashboard shows a global summary of COVID-19 cases inspired by the WHO Dashboard. The dataset has been added to the repository as well. 
This dashboard shows three kinds of information:

1. Spatial Visualization of Countries Most Affected by COVID-19 
2. Week-by-week Tracking of Number of Confirmed Cases
3. Week-by-week Tracking of Number of Deaths

Clicking on each country in the map will show the above stats for its own country. 

Challenges Faced and New Things Tried:

1. Pinpointing what 3 things I want to show
2. Adding text values showing number of confirmed cases and deaths
3. Adding filter by select through Dashboard -> Actions
